# Zeus Instructions

The overall situation has the US forces outnumbered by a much stronger opposition. It should, however, be possible for the players to complete the mission.

## Enemy Faction
 The enemy faction for this Sahrani Liberation Forces (CUP). The player vehicles are all CUP. Do NOT spawn any RHS vehicles. Other factions can be used as long as they are CUP and roughly match the 1982 area.
 
## Enemy Units

The available enemy units mostly resemble Soviet/East-German motorized infantry, mechanized infantry and armored platoons.

Vehicles:
* T-55
* T-72
* BMP-1
* BMP-2
* BRDM
* Trucks (Urals)

Aircraft:
* Mi-24D
* Mi-8 (with and without rockets)

Note: Only spawn aircraft while Sierras are alive.

Infantry:
* Sections
* Squads

Note: It is an armored mission. Strong infantry pushes are not really desireable.

## Preplaced Units

The mission contains preplaced units (defenders) around the bridges, various points along the route and the final objective. There are no scripted reinforcements or wave spawners. Anything dynamic is up to Zeus.

## Mission Maker's Intention

There should be a minor motorized/mechanized infantry attack as players are crossing the bridge. It should mostly keep the units covering busy. Delete or move any stuck vehicles on the bridge to prevent people from dying there unncessarily. Avoid any enemy units on the bridge.

There should be a strong armored counter attack as players have made it past the first town. This should be roughly the middle of the mission.

As players reach their final objective there should be a final counter attack. Strength and type should depend on the number of players and their equipment that is left.

Avoid attacking the Logis whenever possible.

## Performance

The mission uses very aggressive garbage collection to keep up performance. Manually deleting destroyed vehicles and dead units should not be necessary.
